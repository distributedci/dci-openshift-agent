      "message": "In general I don\u0027t like adding long pauses while waiting for something to happen because we\u0027ll be spending 15 minutes regardless of how much the system really takes to reboot.\nWould you consider adding a retry-until opposite to that in #121, so we wait for the API to become unavailable and thus we consider the system is rebooting, so then we can start waiting for the API to become back online.\nMaybe there are more accurate inputs we can probe to detect the host being restarted but the API sounds like a quite intuitive element to monitor.",
