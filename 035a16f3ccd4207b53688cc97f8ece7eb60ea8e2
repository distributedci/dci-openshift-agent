      "message": "I think this is a quick way to avoid the issues we have seen with the must-gather tags in *dallas*.\n\nThis made me think of:\n- How far do we want to get by adding complexity to the agent when things are broken outside?\n- In a connected environment this would\u0027ve failed, so our fix is only targeted to disconnected environments, where the image has been already copied, what\u0027s the true value of the change?\n\nI don\u0027t want to disincentivize the change but IMO, if something is broken with the registry then we have to draw a line at some point.\n\nThoughts?",

      "message": "IMO, precisely because we don\u0027t have control on whether the public registry is broken it makes sense to have these safeguards.\nA different thing would be the correctness of the list of must-gather images that Manny mentions, which is something the user has control over.\nThis being said, I agree with Tony that in the end it\u0027s a matter of where we draw the line for the complexity we want to add to the agent, but also of whether we consider having the latest ose-must-gather image is mandatory or we can afford working with an older version. To me it\u0027s the later rather than the former.",
