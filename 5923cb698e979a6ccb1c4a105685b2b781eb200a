      "message": "Tony, the issue started happening again in the New Mexico lab after applying the chcon command as per the documentation and abandoning this CR.\n\nI read that, by using :z instead of :Z we allow multiple container to share the access on the mounted volume.\n\nWould that not be a valid option.\n\nActually, after running a manual test with :z, the issue seems to have disappeared on its own.\n\nI\u0027m comparing the NM setup with Dallas and Bos2. Bos2, however, is not a good reference since SELinux run in permissive mode there.\n\nComparing the previous labels in NM, with the current ones and those in Dallas, this is what I get:\n\n```\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 dci-openshift-agent dci-openshift-agent unconfined_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0:c1022,c1023 4.0K Nov  1 14:54 4.15.0-0.nightly-2023-11-01-080931\n\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 dci-openshift-agent dci-openshift-agent system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0 4.0K Nov  1 14:54 4.15.0-0.nightly-2023-11-01-080931\n\ndrwxr-xr-x.  2 dciteam dciteam unconfined_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0  4.0K Nov  1 23:58 4.15.0-0.nightly-2023-11-01-080931                                                                                      \n```\n\nSo I see the label c1022,c1023 applied to the failing NM setup. Do you think this could have been the cause?",
