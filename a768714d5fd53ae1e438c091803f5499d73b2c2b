      "message": "Hello Tatiana, \n\nI grabbed a cluster with degraded COs and this change is not working as expected. Also failed in the test https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/462444e0-5661-4191-807c-4cd191f5f66b/files (the job should have failed)\n\nI tried to use \"status.conditions[0]\", with it I got that 2 operators were degraded but those were actually 3. The check that was giving the proper results is the one that is currently in place. And I think that it has been working fine on the dailies. So, I think we should keep the check as it is now.\n\nDebug: http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/1107676\n\nRegards\n\n\n",
