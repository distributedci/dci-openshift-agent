      "message": "IMO, this role can be used in connected and disconnected environments. So maybe just name the task \"Deploy a hosted Gitea Server\". So I suggest changing the flag to something like enable_gitea.\n\nIn disconnected, we use to mirror the image the image into dci_local_registry https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent/blob/master/plays/setup-minio.yml and pass the reference to the role. (if enable_gitea and dci_disconnected)\n\nI recommend creating a new play like: setup-gitea.yml\n\nThanks!",
