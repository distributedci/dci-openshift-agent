      "message": "Thanks Nacho for the change. Some things I\u0027d like to comment/ask:\n\n-I guess this is a temp change. When moving to BOS2, this will be removed, won\u0027t it?\n-As this is a code that is publicly available, I think we should avoid including names such as BOS2 here, but again, as I think this is temp, I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a better way or not. Maybe other people can give their opinion too\n-Where is WORKAROUND_CILAB522 defined? Is it in the d-o-a config file in BOS2? I think we should document this, at least in BOS2 repo.",
