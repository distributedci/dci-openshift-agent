I mean, ` \"${masters[@]}\" `\n\nBecause, in this job for example, not only the suffix to be removed is present, but also the master name is quoted, maybe https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/457c2e92-c387-4c13-b0b3-d55dd57263e7/files. I think that can help, but maybe you also need to check how is taking the master names in order to avoid the quotes in the journal log file.",
