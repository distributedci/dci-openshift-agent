      "message": "Thanks Jorge, we can do that, yes. I\u0027ll propose it here then: https://github.com/dci-labs/bos2-ci-config/pull/78\n\nBut for the agent code, I just wanted to follow the same approach than with baremetal-deploy repo. If you still think it\u0027s not fine to do the same, I\u0027ll close this and just change the BOS2 config, but I fear that, each time we merge something in Crucible, we\u0027ll need to update the var in dci-openshift-agent to point to the new commit. To pin to a specific version is something that we do in other projects, such as cnf-cert or preflight in the app-agent, but linking them to a branch, not to a commit-id. That was my concern, mainly",
