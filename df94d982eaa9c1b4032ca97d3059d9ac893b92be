      "message": "The problem is the CA bundle is managed differently assisted. Somehow the agent installer appends all the public root CAs to the additionalTrustBundle entry in install-config Confirm map. In IPI we only have one entry.\n\nAlso, the variables that we have for assisted/IPI are different. In assisted we pass a PEM file, but in IPI we pass a YAML with the cert + mirroring entries.\n\nI updated the change according to what is available from each install methodâ€”so, avoiding having a new variable.\n\nThanks",
