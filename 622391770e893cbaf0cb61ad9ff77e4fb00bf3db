They\u0027re much appreciated.\n\nSo, for what I see, both using subscription.status.currentCSV and using label selectors to match the right package manifest applying to the installed operator would result in the same (correct) currentCSV value.\n\nI find using the subscription a more straight method, but I\u0027d like to hear your insights.\n\nIn any case, please Beto, check that my last change implements the solution as you thought of it.",
