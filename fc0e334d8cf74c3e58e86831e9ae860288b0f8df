      "message": "Beto, we talked about this yesterday, and I have a question, now that this part is removed would still be possible to upgrade a disconnected cluster without specifying a target version? I wonder if at that point this is required to calculate the target version? Or only the tasks in plays/upgrade-artifacts.yml are required for that?",

      "message": "Hey Many! With DCI, you must specify a target_version to perform mirroring, apply ICs, and run the command. We currently do not support flags like \"--to-latest\".\n\nFrom what I understand about the graph, in disconnected environments, it is useful for making informed decisions regarding upgrades, recommendations, and similar actions, as explained here: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html-single/updating_clusters/index?extIdCarryOver\u003dtrue\u0026intcmp\u003d7013a000002D1gVAAS\u0026sc_cid\u003d701f2000001Css5AAC#how-updates-work\n\nI don\u0027t think this functionality is necessary for the DCI use case at this time. If we want to provide the cluster with such capabilities, it might be better to set the upstream parameter during installation, allowing the cluster to host it. This approach avoids dependency on a web server for installers that don\u0027t require it.",
