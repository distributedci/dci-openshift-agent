      "message": "It\u0027s really curious that the very newest OCP 4.11 release is passing in dallas, just by not installing PAO.\nHowever, I have some questions here:\n- Right now, we are using OCP 4.10 operators for OCP 4.11 deployment, so in theory, PAO can be deployed as we are using OCP 4.10 operators.\n- If we remove PAO right now, example-cnf will not work then in OCP 4.11 until having NTO, won\u0027t it?\n- Also, I guess the idea should be to move to OCP 4.11 operators, but as shown in CILAB-571, PAO and SRIOV operator are not present. PAO issue is solved with this change, but what about SRIOV? Then, example-cnf, e.g., will not work too.",
