      "message": "Hi guys, adding you here in this change, to see if I can improve something in get-ai-logs script. For the moment, this is the first version and I\u0027m running a debug job with assisted that will fail (I\u0027m causing the failure), and where bootstrap VM will be running in master-0, to see if we can retrieve the logs from there or not",
