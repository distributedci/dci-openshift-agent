      "message": "Nacho, thanks for retaking this, I was looking at the results, and in the libvirt job, not all logs were uploaded, maybe not an issue with your patch but in the BOS2 lab, the task \"[Get logs from OCP deployment]\" shows this error: \"ssh: connect to host provisionhost port 22: No route to host\", it would be good to fix that and confirm your change is working well in connected envs.\n\nIn the dallas job the logs were pulled, so I think you change is fine for disconnected envs, but the task \"[Get logs from OCP deployment]\" prints the output of collected logs, in my previous feedback I had suggested to include \"nolog: true\" because it\u0027s a lot of stuff if possible, what do you think?",
