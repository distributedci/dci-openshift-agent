      "message": "@Manuel: In fact, the CNFs jobs were looking for the previous job to get the OCP component. Accessing the previous job is now not authorized in a recent server change because if the CNF-Remoteci doesn\u0027t belongs to the team of the previous job then it must not be able to access it (it was a security/multi-tenancy bug). To workaround this we can leverage the inputs/outputs mechanism of dci-pipeline to pass as an input the OCP component to the next stage (cnf), this is done by writing the data in the file system (shared location).",
