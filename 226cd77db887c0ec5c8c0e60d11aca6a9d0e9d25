All this does is \"wait for the upgrade process to start so we can start monitoring in the next task\".\nI would leave this alone as is, the `--for\u003dcondition\u003dProgressing` is doing exactly what you\u0027re doing here traversing the JSON",

      "message": "As I understand it this allows you to fail quicker if a problem is detected instead of waiting for the retry loop to exit, but it becomes a bit unreadable.\n\nI suggest start by using the k8s_info module (it wasn\u0027t available back when this was written) and start from there. Keep simpler `until` and `failed_when` conditions for the loop.\n\nKeep in mind that the whole upgrade process is done in a reconciliation loop, so it is entirely possible for the status to reach a \"Failing\" status before retrying.",
