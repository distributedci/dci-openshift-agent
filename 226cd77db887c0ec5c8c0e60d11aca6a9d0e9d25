      "message": "I had to update this task because of the condition I was setting on the next one.\n\nThe problem one, on some test execution I saw the Progressing condition transitioning to True and then the Failing condition doing the same immediately while retrieve some data on the upgrade path. The Failing condition would get solved on its own, I gues on retrying, and just after that the message in the Progressing condition would change to \"Moving towards {{ version }}\".\n\nThe goal of this CR is to develop a way to detect a permanent error in the upgrade process without having to rely on the monitor (next task) timeout, so that\u0027s why I also started monitoring the Failing condition (see my comment on the next task).",

      "message": "As I understand it this allows you to fail quicker if a problem is detected instead of waiting for the retry loop to exit, but it becomes a bit unreadable.\n\nI suggest start by using the k8s_info module (it wasn\u0027t available back when this was written) and start from there. Keep simpler `until` and `failed_when` conditions for the loop.\n\nKeep in mind that the whole upgrade process is done in a reconciliation loop, so it is entirely possible for the status to reach a \"Failing\" status before retrying.",
