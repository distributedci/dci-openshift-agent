In the jumphost I see oc has u+x:\n\n$ ls -ln ~/clusterconfigs-cluster?/oc\n-rwxr-xr-x. 1 1004 1004 78607432 Dec  8  2020 /home/dciteam/clusterconfigs-cluster4/oc\n-rwxr-xr-x. 1 1004 1004 72733320 Aug 27 16:19 /home/dciteam/clusterconfigs-cluster5/oc\n-rwxr-xr-x. 1 1004 1004 78607432 Aug 26 02:34 /home/dciteam/clusterconfigs-cluster6/oc\n\nI did a test by doing a fetch with the provisioner being the same as my localhost (\"jumphost\") and copied a file that had u+x and those permissions prevailed, I wonder if some umask of situation is what you are facing when the file is fetched ðŸ˜®",
