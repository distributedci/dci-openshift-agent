      "message": "We had this issue in the past, :Z will cause issues when there are two or more jobs running in the same cached version.\n\nWe had this issue in our Lab and also a partner had it, since, it has been documented that because we don\u0027t have the guarantee that the cache_dir is created by us we won\u0027t change it\u0027s context.\n\nThe requirement is to set the type before hand[1]\n\n\u003e NOTE: If you choose to create the provision_cache_store folder manually, make sure to set the container_file_t setype for it. This will help ensure a smooth installation of OCP nightly builds.\n\n[1] https://docs.distributed-ci.io/dci-openshift-agent/#inventory",
