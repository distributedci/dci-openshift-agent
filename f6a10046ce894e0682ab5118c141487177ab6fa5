      "message": "What\u0027s the benefit of changing the definition of the var in ipi-install.yml to pre-run.yml? For IPI it does not changes any behavior, just changes the place where it is defined.\n\nIt is mentioned that is now in a single location for SNO and IPI, but in sno-install the change is not using that variable.\n\nWhat difference would be if this patch included only  the change in sno-install.yml?",
