      "message": "Yes, those are part of the must_gather as this script collects most of the information via `oc` commands. So, do you think we should stop collecting all that is already on the must-gather?\n\nIMO, It is needed because it is much faster to figure out \"a common\" issue without downloading the must-gather file. \n\nThis script is working mainly in installers that require a provisioner. We may need to think of a more general approach to collect logs later.",

      "message": "If we want to enforce omg, we need to remove all the duplicated outputs. I do not see an option to make it easier. The tool was created for troubleshooting and collecting logs that will be analyzed by a team of engineers via a support ticket. Not sure if a partner or user is interested in taking advantage of the tool. We do it when we need to go in deep or maybe because what we have in the GUI is not enough.\n\nIn my experience omg is slow on my computer, having to download a big file to run a couple of commands that will get stuck for some minutes is a waste of time.\n\nMaybe we can have a fast discussion on a daily regarding this.",

      "message": "From my side I used must-gathers frequently to troubleshoot issues when cluster is not available, since the log outputs (pods, nodes. events) might not contain all. And funny thing is that I usually use the MG to get the MC and MCP information. So I\u0027m up for collecting both quick outputs, if they are not large files and MG to have pod logs. I agree that partners do not seem to use MGs, it\u0027s mostly for us when we want to understand an issue when helping a partner that does not provides access, or when engineering team asked us for information of an OCPBUG.",
