      "message": "Yes, those are part of the must_gather as this script collects most of the information via `oc` commands. So, do you think we should stop collecting all that is already on the must-gather?\n\nIMO, It is needed because it is much faster to figure out \"a common\" issue without downloading the must-gather file. \n\nThis script is working mainly in installers that require a provisioner. We may need to think of a more general approach to collect logs later.",
