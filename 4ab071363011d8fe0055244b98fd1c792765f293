      "message": "I agree, as a first step, I decided to keep some logic regarding OCPGUBS-6676 because, in the end, it is the original issue that caused the reinclusion of the MCP workaround, but it\u0027s true the workaround was wrongly applied, since the nodes were in NotReady status, and we don\u0027t have anything to do with that.\n\nI\u0027m going to do what you\u0027re proposing, to always fail if there\u0027s one node in NotReady status, to avoid wasting time applying the workaround for OCPBUGS-11779. I\u0027ll just only leave one comment to refer to OCPBUGS-6676, to remind that the failure comes from that bug.",
