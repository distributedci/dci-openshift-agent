      "message": "Hi Beto, thanks for taking this, I think it will be quite useful.\n\nLeaving a minor comment from my side.\n\nAnd one thing that I have to add to this. Should we also take care of partners\u0027 repos in terms of logs generated in the hooks? For example, I am aware that there are some of them making use of dci_cluster_configs_dir variable to leave the logs there and they are also taking care of uploading the logs to DCI. Should we make changes there too?",

Actually the source of this requirement is to have something similar to what we have in the app-agent https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CILAB-352.\n\nI have planned to apply something similar to this in the agent and should cover updating the corresponding hooks.",
