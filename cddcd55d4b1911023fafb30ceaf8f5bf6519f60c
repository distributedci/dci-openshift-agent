      "message": "I read initial comments about benefits and complexity, and I agree with some of that, on the other I might be biased to this change because I\u0027ve seen this in action in SPK and during the integration of f5 hooks, I like that we reuse code and benefit from it in all agents and hooks, now we can address sr-iov/mcp checks/workarounds in one place when needed, I see it as we moved it from SPK/BigIPs hooks to d-o-a and encapsulating it in a role. Maybe in the future we can improve it using more k8s than oc client, but from my side I think it\u0027s safe to merge. Just minor typo, I\u0027ll wait for the fix :)",
