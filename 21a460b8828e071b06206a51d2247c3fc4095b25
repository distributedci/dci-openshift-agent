I think the problem was introduced in change 27314\n\nThe omit can\u0027t work in that context because labels is not part of   community.kubernetes.k8s, it is a value of the definition. omit is an ansible command that works with module parameters.  My suggestion is to roll back that change (27314) as it is breaking the functionality.",

Thanks for the hint, Tony.\n\nI thought I had removed all the usage of omit, in 27314.\n\nI\u0027ll take a look.\n\nOK, actually, the problem does come fro 27314, but it looks like the issue is caused by this line in the k8s module call:\n\nlabels: \"{{ ns_labels | default(\u0027omit\u0027) }}\"\n\nWhere omit should not have been in quotes.\n\nThat was a mistake on my side, but I can\u0027t figure out how I got to make it.",
