In the log, you can see that the expected file is generated (and that should be created if the job fails in Check for hyperconverged tasks, showing hco-operator and failed pods\u0027 logs): https://www.distributed-ci.io/files/ab20387e-d135-43a2-b309-fa52f65805d0\n\nAlso, if you take a look to the job, you can see must-gather-cnv worked properly and provided all the logs from all the pods in openshift-cnv namespace, which is what we intend to do with the commands introduced in this change.\n\nSo, I would say, this change wouldn\u0027t be needed as must-gather-cnv is already doing this job. However, I know that there are sometimes in which must-gather does not generate content, so, should we merge anyway this change to save the logs with this manner apart from must-gather one, just in case? Or should we rely on must-gather in any case? @Beto @Tony @Charles",
