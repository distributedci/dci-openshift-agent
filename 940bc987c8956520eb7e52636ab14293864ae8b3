      "message": "Hi Ramon, sure, the error in the previous PR was that I had changed one task in operators-mirror role, it had a `delegate_to` pointing to groups[\u0027registry_host\u0027][0], but in the yaml style inventory there is no such group, there is a *host* named \u0027registry_host\u0027. So I had assumed that \u0027delegate_to\u0027 worked just like when you set a target for a playbook i.e. a host or a group, but that\u0027s not the case, \u0027delegate_to\u0027 requires a host, but it *will not* error if you pass something else like an invalid group or a non existing host. The task to override the disconnected mirrors path \"succeeded\" but not in the host it was needed :(",
