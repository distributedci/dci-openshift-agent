      "message": "Do not feel nervous, changing names is very common these days. ðŸ˜„\n\nIMO, I think that it is good to not make a difference between hub and spoke and keep it generic. Do you think that having the cluster_X_log file will make it more complex to review the log files locally?\n\n\nI want to test the info provided by must-gather for ACM, so will have time to read other\u0027s opinions.\n\nThanks!",
