I saw that, in patchset 11, you removed the definition of this variable in plays/tests.yml because the job failed because \u0027dci_pullsecret_file\u0027 is undefined.\nBut, when you tested that patchset, the failed variable was conformance_local_registry, and for this patchset 12, you have modified its definition but not deleting it.\nSo, I was wondering if this variable is defined in a different place (I checked your PR in inventories repo and it is not there neither), or if its definition is needed again, in case the job fails.",
