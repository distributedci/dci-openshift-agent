I am doing this for  conformance tests because \u0027openshift-tests\u0027 cmd does not accept insecure options.\nSo by adding \"-v {{ conformance_registry_certificate }}:/etc/ssl/certs/domain.crt:z\" we can remove the insecure option. (variable is define here https://github.com/dci-labs/inventories/pull/41/files)\nAnyway, it\u0027s just to let you know, I don\u0027t think it is necessary to change this.",
