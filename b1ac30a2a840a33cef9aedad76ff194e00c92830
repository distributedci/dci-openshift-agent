      "message": "Hello Tatiana, starting this\n\nWe are not allowing the configuration of the api_version for any other resource. In this case, we should use the oc_version var https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent/blob/ef7f33957e196ac6845a4bc8e445cb8678444e77/plays/deploy-operators.yml#L16-L18 and set the api_version as v1beta1 for \u003c\u003d4.7.\n\nAs we are going to remediate other blocks/APIs, what about having a task where we define the xyz_api_version that is deprecated but still available in the OCP version that we are testing\n\n```\n- name: \"Deprecated APIs \u003c\u003d4.7\"\n  set facts:\n    cnv_api_version: v1beta1\n    acm_api_version: v1beta1\n    hco_api_version: v1alpha\n  when:\n    - ocp_version is version(\"4.8\", \"\u003c\") \n```\n\nThen we select the proper one as you are doing here.",
