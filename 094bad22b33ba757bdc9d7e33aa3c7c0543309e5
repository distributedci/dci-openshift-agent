I\u0027ve been reading about Ansible Navigator, but I\u0027m not sure about the benefit of this tool in the agent, since it\u0027s mainly launched using dci-pipeline (an external tool), rather than launching the playbooks with ansible-playbook command.",

Either way I change it due to the uses of ansible-playbook in the documentations. They explain how to create libvirt environment by using Ansible-playbook and I think it\u0027s better to move to navigator, the real change is that navigator working inside the container and can save us from installing many requirement for the dci",
