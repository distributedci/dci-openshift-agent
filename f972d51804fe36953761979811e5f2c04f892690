      "message": "I see that in this version you are removing the information about the disk name and the nodes. I think those lines are important to identify the disk that will be agreggated to the OCS cluster. In libvirt only /dev/sd[b-d] are dedicated for storage. The /dev/sda is used for the OS, I do not think all the disks need to be passed to be configured as volumes.\n\nSo I think that passing to the role the devices as is set now (/dev/sdx) is required and then the role will \"auto-magically\" discover the IDs only for those specific devices.",
