So:\n\n```\nRemove jinja template from playbook and change with_item to loop\n\nTestBos2: virt\n\nChange-Id: ...\n```\n\nYou should be able to do it with `git commit --amend` directly and then run `git-review` , without needing to checkout to another branch. Because I saw it happened the same in https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-agent/+/31902 and you created a new change on https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-agent/+/31906. This operation should not imply to create a new change, it will just add a new review to the gerrit change and that\u0027s all",
