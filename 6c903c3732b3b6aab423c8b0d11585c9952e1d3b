What do you think? ",

      "message": "Hello Charles, you are right, \n\nThe cluster is still applying changes by the time we declared it as Complete. I was taking a look to this and seems like we need to add some extra validations before declaring that the upgrade is done.\n\n- We need to check the machine-config operator to validata the the most recent transition do not have \"PoolUpdating\" as reason\noc get clusteroperator machine-config -o json | jq \u0027.status.conditions[]\u0027\n\n- Also, it will be good to check that the cluster operators are all \"Available\" instead of just \"degraded\"\n\nThe MCPs were still pending to be applied on 3 workers seem to be related to hugepages reconfiguration.\n\nI added some of the findings here: http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/1091608\n\nThanks!",
