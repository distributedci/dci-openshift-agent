I see the job where this was tested set the ownership to `dciteam:` instead `dci-openshift-agent` what the other dirs have.\nThis could explain the failure we had a few weeks back as `dci-openshift-agent` was unable to write inside /opt/cache.\nNot saying this is wrong, but I think we need to figure out what\u0027s the right user that should be creationg those directories 😄",
