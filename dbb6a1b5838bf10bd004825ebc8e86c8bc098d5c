      "message": "This is a new way to deal with catalogs starting in 4.6 (when opm was introduced) The docs state:\n\nWhen creating custom catalog images, previous versions of OpenShift Container Platform 4 required using the oc adm catalog build command, which has been deprecated for several releases. With the availability of Red Hat-provided index images starting in OpenShift Container Platform 4.6, catalog builders should start switching to using the opm index command to manage index images before the oc adm catalog build command is removed in a future release\n\nsource: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.html#olm-understanding-operator-catalog-images_olm-restricted-networks",
