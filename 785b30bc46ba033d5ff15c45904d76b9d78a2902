      "message": "Previously there was a change that removed the need to connect to a URL to get the release.txt file in SNO, it is now provided through the extraction of the artifacts in the release image.\nThe caveat of that change is that the pull_url is a requirement now. It is not an issue for SNO in the agent, as the pull_url is provided in every job. But, it could be an issue if someone is using SNO roles on their own.  I can get that fixed in a different change but at the moment nightly builds are working in SNO (https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-agent/+/27122/18#message-998fa32d56442e9879e8df461a9d284e5b3f7494)",
