      "message": "Thanks for simplifying this Tony, but I have a question. Comparing this change with https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-agent/+/25823, how do we force the execution of a job in a particular cluster? In my change, I defined DCI_CLUSTER_RESOURCE for that purpose, and I believe it can be used here too in the same way",
