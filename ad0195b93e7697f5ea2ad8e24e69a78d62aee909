Do we need default values in some assignments for dealing with that?\n\nI think it is not really needed, as the last libvirt job has passed, but anyway, just in case, I propose this topic to discuss.",

We are not doing it for the other already defined test. \n\nHas been a bit complicated to deal with variables that do not exist when you run only the redhat-tests. We will need to review how to be able to run just some tags without having issues with variables that are not available.",
