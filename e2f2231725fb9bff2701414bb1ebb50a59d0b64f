Is truly an advantage on this change? As to me this code is becoming more complex now than it used to be. Thanks!",

      "message": "Hi Tony, thanks for your comment. We can review this next Monday, but mainly, the two objectives of this change are:\n\n- First of all, to use the same role to do the MCP check (done on d-o-a, d-o-a-a and example-cnf, mainly) and the SRIOV check (done on SPK and BigIP hooks), as the workaround is mostly the same but the only change is the resource to be checked\n- Secondly, to add retries to this role, which is currently done on check-sriov but not on wait-mcp, and it had happened that the workaround was applied, the check passed, but a new node moved to SchedulingDisabled after a while and the job failed in a further step of the job. With this, we managed to avoid this effect on BigIP/SPK.",
