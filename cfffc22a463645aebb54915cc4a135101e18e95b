      "message": "Hi Charles,\nThe problem with the OCP upgrade is, due to the reconciliation loop, every failure condition will eventually got back to \"progressing\" state, so there is no way to identify a permanent failure just by checking the status of the cluster version.\nSo as an intermediate solution we implemented the monitor as a state machine. If the script finds a failure and it does not turn back to \"progressing\" in less that 15 minutes, the monitor assumes the failure is permanent.",
