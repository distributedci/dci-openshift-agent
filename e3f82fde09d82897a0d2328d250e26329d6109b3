      "message": "All the changes related to adding the dci_workarounds LGTM.\n\nThe part that adds BZ2053445 I think should be in a different change.\n\nI have 2 main concerns with the latter:\n1. The BZ was reported for 4.7 but I see it was added to practically all the versions in the pipelines (https://github.com/dci-labs/dallas-pipelines/pull/241/files), do we really need the workaround on all of them?\n2. The mcp check is done in more than 1 place, do we need the workaround on all those places?",
