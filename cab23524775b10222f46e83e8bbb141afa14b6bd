      "message": "It is known that if you have multiple operators in one namespace and at least one is in Manual mode, it will force all subscriptions to be Manual if they are set in Automatic.\nI see today we create the subscription, and by default sets the installPlanApproval to Automatic if we set none, then we wait for the CSV and then we patch to set to Manual. So under that logic if we install a second operator in the same namespace it will have the issue you are seeing Nacho, that is the new operator will have its initial subscription set to Automatic but the CSV will not show up because there is already a subscription in Manual mode from another operator. Afaik this should require to approve install plans with another tasks. I\u0027m curios to see the results of your tests with this patch using multiple operators in the same namespace.\n\nAlso I wonder now that you moved the Subscription patch to change the installplan to Manual just after creating the initial subscription, I wonder why not just have one task that creates the initial subscription with the desired installPlanApproval from the beginning?",
