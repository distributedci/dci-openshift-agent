Because it\u0027s not used in the first d-o-a job, it is used in the second one for the upgrade.\n- Do we also have to look at UPGRADE_ARGS? Because it may happen that UPGRADE_ARGS doesn\u0027t include any reference to the component to be used. Should we consider that check instead? (to see if UPGRADE_ARGS contains something regarding components).",
