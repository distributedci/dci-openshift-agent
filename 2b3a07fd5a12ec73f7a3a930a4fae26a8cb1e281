      "message": "Hello Tatiana, \n\nI have 2 main concerns regarding this change. \n\n1) The purpose of this role is to mirror a catalog to a registry and provide the ICSP/IDMS. There is no need of having a cluster running. Here we are adding a requirement to a KUBECONFIG.\n\n2) We are using a role the role to share a playbook between agents. That is a good idea for those kind of needs but I will prefer to have a new role with shared plays between agents instead of using a role with a well defined scope.\n\nI think that we should restart the pod just after deleting a catalog pod, just for the sake of sanity. I will submit a proposal with the change and talk about the selected option.\n\nThanks",
