      "message": "I wonder if we really need these logs, clusterversion/version, and clusteroperator. All of them we can get the through must gather.\n\nI know that some of them are quite useful without having to go and download must-gather and everything else. But I would say that if something is needed for debugging then we probably should use must-gather.\n\nWith that being said, I think I support part of Pierre\u0027s proposal to leave them without yaml output as they are quite useful like text for a quick view. If we need details then use must-gather? wdyt?",

It is definitely doable but slower than just one click :/\n\nIf we add more unique files, must-gather lose interest. If it is too boring to use it we have to think about a way to accelerate its usage.\n\nExample:\n- add a feature to execute omg on tar.gz\n- add an embedded version on omg in dci web site",
