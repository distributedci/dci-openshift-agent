I think that, to include that change in this change, you need to use this change as base and create a new commit on top of it, instead of creating a different change. Anyway, I think 25759 can be merged, then we can rebase this one and retest.",

In that case the changes are separate enough to be kept independent which means that if you need to fix changes from review comments you can do it on a per patch basis. It is also true for rebasing each patch.\n```\n\nhttps://docs.openstack.org/contributors/code-and-documentation/patch-best-practices.html",
