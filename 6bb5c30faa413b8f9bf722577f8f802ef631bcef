This is, doing it in the same way you disabled the cnf tests and this just for testing.\n\nThe error seen above, is a wrong configuration (inventory and pipeline)\n\nThe check was requesting:\n\n- To install CNF, \"dci_prepare_cnf: true\" (pipeline)\n- To not mirror any image,  opm_mirror_list was not defined (pipeline)\n- To do it disconnected, dci_disconnected\u003dtrue (inventory)\n\nThis is a misconfiguration, because a cluster can\u0027t be disconnected, asking to install CNF and not mirror its images.\n\nThen, it all depends on what you want to test, e.g.\n\nIf you want to test a disconnected env without opm_mirror_list then yes, you have to not only set \"dci_prepare_cnf: false\" but also not run any other setting that expects CNF.",
