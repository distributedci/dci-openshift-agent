That is executed during teardown so will be executed and you have guaranteed that the target directory exists. \n\nI am working on a change to have the log-dir available on all the stages and use that instead of using dci_cluster_configs_dir.",

      "message": "Hi Beto. I have my concerns regarding declaring this in get-logs, because the idea is just to retrieve the logs when we have a failure in this task. As I said to Charles, the \"always\" block that I have defined is just to confirm that the commands work. After doing that check, I will remove it, just leaving the \"rescue\" block. So, if I did it in get-logs, I wouldn\u0027t know where the error were produced, so that I could not determine if I have to execute these commands for HCO or not. That\u0027s why I have defined it in that way.\n\nThen, I will try with a new run with the current status, and if worked, I will remove the \"always\" block definitely. I will also try to validate the content of must-gather-cnv.\n\nIs it fine?",
