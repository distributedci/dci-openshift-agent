      "message": "So, the thing is hub_kubeconfig_path is how the ACM pipelines are set to pass the file path between from the hub to the spoke deployment stages.\n\nkubeconfig_path is the way the configure_ztp_gitops_apps role uses the variable, so I added the assignation in the block in case it could be reused by other roles, but since there\u0027s only one role using it I rather move the kubeconfig_path variable creation to the task importing the role, and using hub_kubeconfig_path everywhere else, to help differentiating between it and the spoke kubconfig file that will be created on deploying the spoke.\n\nI hope I made it clear.",
