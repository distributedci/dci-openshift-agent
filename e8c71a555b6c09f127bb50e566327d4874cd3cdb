      "message": "Charles, I think we need two things here:\n- firstly, make this task to work if `reg_mcpool_worker.resources[0].status.machineCount \u003e\u003d 1`, which was never tested before, I think. My impression is that this condition is now correct, aligned with the previous one that checked the renderer-worker MC but somehow it\u0027s failing... maybe we would need to retrieve the logs here",

      "message": "I think I understand what is is going on:\n\n* From what I understood, this initial condition \u0027machineCount \u003d\u003d 0\u0027 is faulty, because it means it running in SNO mode, or more precisely SNO-AI. In SNO, the only node is part of the master MC. But, as the Performance profile used here is targeting only the worker node, the Master MCP is not modified so the \u0027until condition\u0027 will never succeed.\n\n* By fixing the when condition in my test, it failed because even in a classic libvirt install, the master MC is not reg-generated so the only reason this condition has never failed before is only because the \u0027when\u0027 condition is faulty.",
