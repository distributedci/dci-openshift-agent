      "message": "Thanks, Nacho, I took a look at that during the change. The command supports a list of servers. Those are supposed to be only masters, but I didn\u0027t see any side effect of passing the workers too. \n\nI would prefer to keep it that way, or if that is not looking good just filter the masters based on its name. I do not want to add parameters for masters and workers to the script. \n\nCheers",
