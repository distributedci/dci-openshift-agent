      "message": "Hi, Beto.\n\nDo you have any idea on why this step is needed?\n\nThe way I see it, and considering your change, we create a list of operators that must be upgraded. Then we set them to manual install approval, just to move them back to automatic some 5 tasks later.\n\nhttps://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent/blob/6b63c13652f93b9a1053f4857da3944878f8f3ce/plays/upgrade-csv.yml#L63\n\nMeanwhile, the operators that must not be upgrade may retain their install plan approval set to automatic.\n\n(Sorry if it\u0027s not strictly related to your change).",
