Should we need to include a new hint to consider we are running ABI, just to clearly distinguishing it from AI? Because right now we are testing all installer in BOS2 on a daily basis, and we currently test AI and AI-SNO, and with this change, maybe we can add ABI too, but as it\u0027s following the same hint than assisted, it may be confusing how to differentiate between them when checking the jobs",
