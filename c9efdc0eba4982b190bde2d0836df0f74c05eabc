      "message": "Hello Ramon. I updated the example according to its purpose (upgrade example) and the post notes. I think it is okay to get rid of that partially controlling something that is not available. \n\nI think the change is good for review. I have done a lot of testing and the change that concerns me is https://github.com/dci-labs/dallas-pipelines/pull/957 because there are pipelines that we do not test much.\n\nI will generate a new summary of the relevant tests performed today.\n\nThanks!",
