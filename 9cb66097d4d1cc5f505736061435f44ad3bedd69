      "message": "You\u0027re right Jorge, but just to give some context here; this code structure is probably based on the wait-mcp workaround, which has this structure because, at the beginning, there were multiple OCPBUGS pointing to that playbook, and for each OCPBUGS, there were a specific workaround to follow, that\u0027s why each OCPBUGS was included in a different block, having a fail task which was common for all of them.\nBut yes, now that there\u0027s only one OCPBUGS attached, the block is probably useless.\nI\u0027ve removed it from the wait-mcp task in this change, just to follow that: https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-agent/+/29119, the same should be done here",
